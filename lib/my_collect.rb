#you are writing a method that behaves just like the real `#collect` method. It should take in an argument of a #collection, iterate over that collection using a `while` loop, #and execute the code in the block you call it with for each #element in the collection (use the `yield` keyword). It should #return the modified collection.

 collection = ["ruby", "javascript", "python", "objective-c"]

   while i < array.length 
   new_arr.push yield(array[i])
